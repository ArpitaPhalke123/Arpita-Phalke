## Projects 💻

### 🛰️ Solar Panel Crack Detection Using Image Processing

This project automates the detection of cracks in solar panels using deep learning and image processing. It leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and transfer learning with VGG16 to classify images of solar panels as damaged or undamaged. The system is designed to support proactive maintenance by identifying cracks early, improving solar panel efficiency and longevity.

📌 Technologies Used: Python, CNN, VGG16, OpenCV, TensorFlow, Keras
